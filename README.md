# Python

The command palette.

Some of my favorites:

- Esc will take you into command mode where you can navigate around your notebook with arrow keys.
While in command mode:
- A to insert a new cell above the current cell, B to insert a new cell below.
M to change the current cell to Markdown, Y to change it back to code
- D + D (press the key twice) to delete the current cell
- Enter will take you from command mode back into edit mode for the given cell.
- Shift + Tab will show you the Docstring (documentation) for the the object you have just typed in a code cell - you can keep pressing this short cut to cycle through a few modes of documentation.
- Ctrl + Shift + - will split the current cell into two from where your cursor is.
- Esc + F Find and replace on your code but not the outputs.
Esc + O Toggle cell output.
Select Multiple Cells:
Shift + J or Shift + Down selects the next sell in a downwards direction. You can also select sells in an upwards direction by using Shift + K or Shift + Up.
Once cells are selected, you can then delete / copy / cut / paste / run them as a batch. This is helpful when you need to move parts of a notebook.
You can also use Shift + M to merge multiple cells.


- The triple quotes are used to span the string across multiple lines. For example, all the following are legal-```
word = 'word'sentence = "This is a sentence."paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It ismade up of multiple lines and sentences."""

```

> >  ss
> > 
> > 
> > 



- Python does not have multiple-line commenting feature. You have to comment each line individually as follows-

*s*
`
dsds **

1. 1. ![]()



1. ss
2. dssds
`


`	# This is a comment.	# This is a comment, too.	# This is a comment, too.	# I said that already.	`
	
[]()


`sdsd`


```

```
